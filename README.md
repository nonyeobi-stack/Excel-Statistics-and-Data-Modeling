# Excel-Statistics-and-Data-Modeling
This repository showcases a comprehensive application of statistical methodologies to solve real-world business problems using Microsoft Excel.
​📂 Project Case Studies

​1. California Real Estate: Descriptive Analysis
​Methodology: Performed an exploratory data audit of property markets.
​Key Skills: Mean/Median analysis, standard deviation, and data visualization to identify pricing trends and market outliers.

​2. Confidence Interval Analysis: Inferential Statistics
​Methodology: Moved beyond raw data to estimate population parameters with 95% confidence.
​Key Skills: Calculated margins of error and confidence intervals to provide actionable business ranges for decision-making.

​3. Weight and Payroll: Statistical Inference Audit
​Methodology: Applied hypothesis testing to workplace and physiological data.
​Key Skills: Used T-testing and Z-testing to determine if observed variations in payroll and weight metrics were statistically significant or due to chance.

​4. Used Car Price Prediction: Multiple Linear Regression
​Methodology: Built a predictive model to estimate vehicle values based on mileage, year, and brand prestige.
​Log Transformation: Applied LN transforms to fix data skewness and ensure model linearity.
​Interactive Tool: Integrated an EXP function to convert abstract log-results back into real-world dollar valuations (e.g., predicting a 2020 Renault at $3,374).

​🛠️ Technical Toolkit
​Analysis: Descriptive Statistics, Inferential Audits, Hypothesis Testing (P-Values, T-Stats).
​Modeling: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, Dummy Variables, Log-Normal Transformations.
​Visualization: Scatter plot matrices, Linearity/Homoscedasticity checks.
